## Professional Service
### Equality Diversity and Inclusivity
I sit on the Equlity, Diversity and Inclusivity committee of the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds. As a committee we contribute to Faculty EDI Community of Practice events, act as a task and finish group to address EDI issues at the School and Faculty level and act as the EDI points of contact for the School. In this role I have recently won independent funding to become trained as a Mental Health First Aid instructor. This will allow the School to deliver bespoke MHFA courses to staff in safe guarding roles, particularly fieldwork and student supervision.

### Mineral Physics Special Interest Group
As an ordinary committee member of the <a href="https://www.minersoc.org/mpg.html"> Mineral Physics Special Interest Group Mineralogical Society of the UK and Ireland</a> I assist in organising yearly Research in Progress meetings and help coordination of travel bursaries for early career researchers.
