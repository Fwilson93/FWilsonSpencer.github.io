# Mineral Physicist and Geophysicist

**Hi, my name is Fred. Here you will find some details on my work and interests. My priniciple area of reasearch is the key processes in the metallic cores and magma oceans of rocky planets which facilitate habitable conditions at the surface. I work within the  <a href="https://planetarycores.leeds.ac.uk/">  Leeds Centre for Planetary Cores</a> but collaborate broadly, so if you have ideas, I'm all ears! Feel free to send me an email or catch me at a conference. I am regularly at the AGU and EGU annual meetings and help organise the Mineral Physics Group Research in Progress meetings.**

## Research
### Nucleation of the Earth's Solid Inner Core
Figuring out when the Earth's solid inner core began to freeze is easy right? The core is cooling down, so just find the time when the temperature of the core drops below the melting temperature. The trouble is that all liquids actually have to be supercooled to below the melting temperature before they begin to freeze. Did you know that water can be supercooled to 30 C below its melting temperature before it forms hail in the atmosphere, provided there is no dust to help the nucleation along. Even with dust and supercooling, there is still a waiting time for liquids to freeze. This is because the solid only starts to grown once the random vibrations of atoms arrange to form a solid of a critical size.
When we estimate how much supercooling is needed to kick start inner core growth, we get between 700 and 1000 K, huge! The problem is that if we estimate gow much supercooling is possible in the core, based on not freezing too much of the core, we get 200 to 400 K. This is the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2018.01.018">inner core nucleation paradox</a> and it shows that mineral physics implies that the inner core either hasn't seen enough supercooling to begin growing yet, or should have frozen most of the core, neither of which are true! I have developed methods to study the nucleation process using <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.103.214113">molecular dynamic simulations</a> at conditions of Earth's core and shown that whilst <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2023.118176">pure iron, FeSi and FeS are hopelessly incapable of resolving this paradox</a>, FeO gets us a bit closer and <a href="https://doi.org/10.31223/X53D8H">FeC might actually offer a resolution to the paradox!</a> 
Watch this space for a review we have coming (hopefully) soon which shows how and why this paradox matters for the thermal history of Earth.

### Precipitation of Light Elements from the Earth's Outer Core
Ever wonder why we and our ancestors in the primordial soup aren't being cooked by solar radiation? It's because the Earth has had a strong dipolar magentic field for at least the past 3.5 million years of course! But during this time the dynamics of the Earth's liquid core (which produces this field) have changed significantly, so how has it been so consistent? Well it turns out that this is quite tricky to do, the problem even has it's own <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JB025355">paradox<a/>. The geodynamo producing the field was originally driven by the gradual cooling of the core, until the inner core began to grow and the associated processes from this continue to provide plentiful power to this day. The bit between these two is the hard part, by the time the inner core began to grow, there was likely very little heat left for powering the dynamo and models suggest that the field should have been extinguished, which is not what we see in the palaeomagnetic record, which preserves the signal of the field. So, we need to find other ways of powering the field. One way is radiogenic heating, but <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pepi.2023.107073">we find that this just isnt sufficient</a>. Another route is through light element precipitation. Iron is actually a pretty good solvent at high temperatures and pressures (as convieniently found in Earth's core) and can incorperate elements like silicon and magnesium. As the core cooled, it became a less efficient solvent and had to precipitate some fraction of these elements to maintain chemical equilibrium. This would happen at the coldest point, which is the top of the core, and leave behind an iron rich liquid, which is dense. This dense liquid would then sink, helping to drive the geodynamo through the energy contributed to convetion. It turns out that this process is pretty efficient and the main question is how much precipitate can be released and how fast. We find that <a href=" https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GL100692">silicon precipitation can provide enough power to not let the magnetic field collapse<a/>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pepi.2023.107073">magnesium can too, but with some caveats<a/>.

## Professional Service
### Equality Diversity and Inclusivity
I sit on the Equlity, Diversity and Inclusivity committee of the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds. As a committee we contribute to Faculty EDI Community of Practice events, act as a task and finish group to address EDI issues at the School and Faculty level and act as the EDI points of contact for the School. In this role I have recently won independent funding to become trained as a Mental Health First Aid instructor. This will allow the School to deliver bespoke MHFA courses to staff in safe guarding roles, particularly fieldwork and student supervision.

### Mineral Physics Special Interest Group
As an ordinary committee member of the <a href="https://www.minersoc.org/mpg.html"> Mineral Physics Special Interest Group Mineralogical Society of the UK and Ireland</a> I assist in organising yearly Research in Progress meetings and help coordination of travel bursaries for early career researchers.
