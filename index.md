# Mineral Physicist and Geophysicist

**Hi, my name is Fred. Here you will find some details on my work and interests. My priniciple area of reasearch is the key processes in the metallic cores and magma oceans of rocky planets which facilitate habitable conditions at the surface. I work within the  <a href="https://planetarycores.leeds.ac.uk/">  Leeds Centre for Planetary Cores</a> but collaborate broadly, so if you have ideas, I'm all ears! Feel free to send me an email or catch me at a conference. I am regularly at the AGU and EGU annual meetings and help organise the Mineral Physics Group Research in Progress meetings.**

## Professional Service
### Equality Diversity and Inclusivity
I sit on the Equlity, Diversity and Inclusivity committee of the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds. As a committee we contribute to Faculty EDI Community of Practice events, act as a task and finish group to address EDI issues at the School and Faculty level and act as the EDI points of contact for the School. In this role I have recently won independent funding to become trained as a Mental Health First Aid instructor. This will allow the School to deliver bespoke MHFA courses to staff in safe guarding roles, particularly fieldwork and student supervision.

### Mineral Physics Special Interest Group
As an ordinary committee member of the <a href="https://www.minersoc.org/mpg.html"> Mineral Physics Special Interest Group Mineralogical Society of the UK and Ireland</a> I assist in organising yearly Research in Progress meetings and help coordination of travel bursaries for early career researchers.
