# Mineral Physicist and Geophysicist

**Hi, my name is Fred. Here you will find some details on my work and interests. My priniciple area of reasearch is the key processes in the metallic cores and magma oceans of rocky planets which facilitate habitable conditions at the surface. I work within the  <a href="https://planetarycores.leeds.ac.uk/">  Leeds Centre for Planetary Cores</a> but collaborate broadly, so if you have ideas, I'm all ears! Feel free to send me an email or catch me at a conference. I am regularly at the AGU and EGU annual meetings and help organise the Mineral Physics Group Research in Progress meetings.**

## Research
### Nucleation of the Earth's Solid Inner Core
Figuring out when the Earth's solid inner core began to freeze is easy right? The core is cooling down, so just find the time when the temperature of the core drops below the melting temperature. The trouble is that all liquids actually have to be supercooled to **below** the melting temperature before they begin to freeze. Did you know that water can be supercooled to 30 C below its melting temperature before it forms hail in the atmosphere, provided there is no dust to help the nucleation along. Even with dust and supercooling, there is still a waiting time for liquids to freeze. This is because the solid only starts to grown once the random vibrations of atoms arrange to form a solid of a critical size.
When we estimate how much supercooling is needed to kick start inner core growth, we get between 700 and 1000 K, huge! The problem is that if we estimate gow much supercooling is possible in the core, based on not freezing too much of the core, we get 200 to 400 K. This is the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2018.01.018">inner core nucleation paradox</a> and it shows that mineral physics implies that the inner core either hasn't seen enough supercooling to begin growing yet, or should have frozen most of the core, neither of which are true! I have developed methods to study the nucleation process using <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.103.214113">molecular dynamic simulations</a> at conditions of Earth's core and shown that whilst <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2023.118176">pure iron, FeSi and FeS are hopelessly incapable of resolving this paradox</a>, FeO gets us a bit closer and <a href="https://doi.org/10.31223/X53D8H">FeC might actually offer a resolution to the paradox!</a> 
Watch this space for a review we have coming (hopefully) soon which shows how and why this paradox matters for the thermal history of Earth.

## Professional Service
### Equality Diversity and Inclusivity
I sit on the Equlity, Diversity and Inclusivity committee of the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds. As a committee we contribute to Faculty EDI Community of Practice events, act as a task and finish group to address EDI issues at the School and Faculty level and act as the EDI points of contact for the School. In this role I have recently won independent funding to become trained as a Mental Health First Aid instructor. This will allow the School to deliver bespoke MHFA courses to staff in safe guarding roles, particularly fieldwork and student supervision.

### Mineral Physics Special Interest Group
As an ordinary committee member of the <a href="https://www.minersoc.org/mpg.html"> Mineral Physics Special Interest Group Mineralogical Society of the UK and Ireland</a> I assist in organising yearly Research in Progress meetings and help coordination of travel bursaries for early career researchers.
